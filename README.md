# Academia
University data, beautifully presented at your fingertips.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We completely rewritten AcademiaPro, reducing more bloat, useless algorithms and infact whole new engine under the hood!
> AcademiaPro now uses its very own web scraper instead of some third-party APIs. We call it `proscrape`
> 
> Our proscrape uses `Edge Networks` which helped us to make all of our data requests under 2 seconds. I mean **ALL** of the data needed. Instead of taking 6-10 seconds on just logging in like [srmcheck](https://a.srmcheck.me)

## Why Academia ?

- Mobile-First approach
- Fast, Zippy and RAM Friendly
- Open source
- Generates Timetable
- Safe, Secure yet transparent
- No bloat

### Idea behind

> Academia is a mess. we scraped it so, we know it. lol. And we got SRM Check but its bloated with useless crap and ads. So here we are with our take. We aren't responsible for the slow loading times, blame the SRM servers, we tried our best.
